> *Congratulations on finishing another SwiftUI project! With technologies like Core Data at your side, you’re now capable of building some serious apps that interact with the user and – most importantly – remember what they entered. Although we only scratched the surface or Core Data, it’s capable of a lot more and I expect Apple to keep expanding the link between Core Data and SwiftUI in future updates. In the meantime, the very next project focuses deeply on Core Data – there’s lots to explore!.*

## &nbsp; 🎖 Challenge
* [x] Right now it’s possible to select no title, author, or genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing defaults, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose

* [x] Modify `ContentView` so that books rated as 1 star are highlighted somehow, such as having their name shown in red.

* [x] Add a new “date” attribute to the Book entity, assigning `Date.now` to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in `DetailView`.
